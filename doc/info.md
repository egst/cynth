# General info

## Documentation

There is no documentation currently. All files in this directory are my personal notes
and might contain outdated information.

## Tests

More thorough and maybe even automated tests will be added as soon as possible.
However, for now, these test files are more useful as just simple examples of the resulting Cynth code to concider.

Current test files mostly contain outdated examples. Semantics of the language are still evolving
to acommodate implementation and run-time complexity.
