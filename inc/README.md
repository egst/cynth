# Structure

Everything, except for the `esl` library (see `esl/README.md`), is located in the top-level `::cynth` namespace.
Some header files (`.hpp`) have corresponding implementation files (`.cpp`) with the same name in the same location
under `src/` instead of `inc/`. Directories don't necessarilly correspond to namespaces.
For more information about the project structure, see individual `README.md` files in other directories.
